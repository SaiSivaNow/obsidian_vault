When we build a new product, trying out a new idea, just like when we launch a startup company, there is no guarantee we are building the right product, for the right people, or at the right time.  
  
Maybe we are working on a wrong product, maybe we are launching a wrong feature, maybe we launch it too early, too late ... imagine you had an idea to launch touch screen smart phones in 1995 instead of 2007? Brilliant idea, but it would be destined to fail. 50-90% of the startup ideas will fail. 75% of the venture backed startups in US can't give the money back to their investors. They do not stop us from taking risks and trying.  
  
But there is one thing we can control as software development team: engineering. No matter the product succeeds or fails, we can always practice good engineering disciplines, there is no excuse for bad engineering. As long as we do that, we can get something good out of the worK, at least good lessons.

Next by Jobs is great at engineering but bad as a product. But this helped what apple is today few years later when Jobs reused Next.
