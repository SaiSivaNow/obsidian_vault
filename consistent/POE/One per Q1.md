One Thing Worth Remembering Per Quarter [#sdm](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=sdm&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7023886766067564544) [#roadmap](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=roadmap&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7023886766067564544) [#goalsetting](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=goalsetting&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7023886766067564544)

And don’t say you will ‘improve xxx deployment pipeline’. That sounds boring! Say something like ‘we will make deploying changes to production 2 times faster!’ See the difference! ‘Improve’ is a mechanism to a goal, it is not the goal. Articulate the result that will delight your stakeholders. Don’t get trapped in the weeds of implementation details in your roadmap.

Of course I have to improve my swimming techniques to endure the two miles. But improving swimming as a goal is boring. Swimming across Washington Lake, that is the One thing I will remember for the rest of my life!
