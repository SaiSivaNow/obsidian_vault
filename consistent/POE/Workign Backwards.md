Live backwards  
  
Amazon taught me how to work backwards: we start with imagining the final product is ready to ship. We draft a press release announcing the product’s availability. We try our hardest to describe, in the most concrete way, how our customers are delighted. We quote customers’ exciting comments about their experiences in the press release. This process may feel quite new age at the beginning. I certainly thought so in my first few press release writings. But gradually I started to appreciate the power of the 

working backwards process - it allows us to focus on customer’s need, or customer’s pain: the **“what and why”**, without being distracted by the technical details of “how”, or the project schedule details of “who and when”. The working backwards process becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. 

**Even when we fail to get the right solution, as long as the problem is right, we can just keep trying.**
