SDE is mostly concerned about tactical things doesn't have very broder vision. On other SDM considers below things.

There are three key factors for a manager to consider:  
1. Deliver the right results at the right time to delight the right customers or stakeholders  
2. Give team members the right opportunities to grow their careers.
3. Optimize results and visibility on project management and people management for the SDM’s own career growth

“Then it won’t be considered a career opportunity for Bob. Not every project needs to be career opportunity. We all do boring things to keep the world running. But since you have other team members that can drive X, maybe a little slower, why not give it to them? They can learn something out of project X while Bob can get project Y going…Is there a hard deadline for project X?”, I asked.
