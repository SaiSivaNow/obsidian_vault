“Why didn’t we write some prototypes to validate the design proposals?” I asked.

**Analysis paralysis** (or **paralysis by analysis**) describes an individual or group process where [overanalyzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis "Analysis") or **overthinking** a situation can cause forward motion or [decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making "Decision-making") to become "paralyzed", meaning that no solution or course of action is decided upon within a natural time frame. A situation may be deemed too complicated and a decision is never made, or made much too late, due to [anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety "Anxiety") that a potentially larger problem may arise. A person may desire a [perfect solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology) "Perfectionism (psychology)"), but may fear making a decision that could result in error, while on the way to a better solution. Equally, a person may hold that a superior solution is a short step away, and stall in its endless pursuit, with no concept of [diminishing returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns "Diminishing returns"). On the opposite end of the time spectrum is the phrase **extinct by instinct**, which is making a fatal decision based on hasty judgment or a gut reaction.

Analysis paralysis is when the fear of either making an error or forgoing a superior solution outweighs the realistic expectation or potential value of success in a decision made in a timely manner. This imbalance results in suppressed decision-making in an unconscious effort to preserve existing options. An overload of options can overwhelm the situation and cause this "paralysis", rendering one unable to come to a conclusion. It can become a larger problem in critical situations where a decision needs to be reached, but a person is not able to provide a response fast enough, potentially causing a bigger issue than they would have had, had they made a decision

They usually fall into anti-patterns:  
  
1. Project without customer or stakeholder, no real requirement, therefore without meaningful value to anyone. Believe or not, software industry has many bullsh*t projects that deliver no real values - a way to keep people busy I guess. I often ask my project leads: “name one concrete person that will be delighted if you complete the project. If you can’t find even one person, well don’t waste your time.”  
  
2. Project with too many stakeholders, too many requirements that are often conflicting each other. We go into endless discussions, endless meetings that go nowhere other than the conclusion “let’s have another meeting.” People come to these meetings to get visibility, rather than solving a real problem.  
  
3. Project that has no design, no plan, and usually no deadline. I am not a big fan of very detailed design or project plan. But “plans are nothing, planning is everything!” As Dwight D. Eisenhower once said.  
  
4. Project that has too much design, too many discussions, mountain of documents, but no code, no prototype, no Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In this situation, delivering something is infinitely better than delivering nothing. Divide the problem into smaller ones, split what can be decided now from what need more discussions later, start small and iterate, and code the components that need to be there no matter what.  
  
5. Project that cannot give any sprint demos. If a project cannot provide demos for consecutive sprints, it is usually a sign the project is off track.  
  
6. Projects that rely on a shining new technology for success, rather than careful planning and disciplined executions. How many times we’ve seen comments like “if only we could rewrite the application in programming language X or database Y (often a NoSQL db jargon), all the problems will be solved.” Well, I committed such sins in my career a few times. I’ve seen well intentioned effort to rewrite large Perl applications into Java, which became just Perl programming in Java grammars. Now we have a new problem!
